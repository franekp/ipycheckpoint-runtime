# Development

Setup:
run `. first-time-setup.sh` or `. activate-setup.sh`, depending if first time in a given codespace or not.
Build:
run `./build.sh`
Serve:
run `./serve.sh` in a codespace. A forwarded port will appear, go there, open browser dev tools and develop.
Codespaces and development work better on Chrome than on Firefox.
